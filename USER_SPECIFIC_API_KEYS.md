# User-Specific API Keys Implementation

## Overview

The API keys system has been updated to support user-specific API keys. Now each user has their own set of API keys that only they can view, create, edit, and delete.

## What Changed

### Database Schema
- **Added `user_id` column** to `api_keys` table with foreign key reference to `users(id)`
- **Added database index** on `user_id` for better query performance
- **Updated RLS (Row Level Security) policies** to enforce user-specific access
- **Cascade delete** - when a user is deleted, their API keys are automatically removed

### API Routes
All API key operations now require authentication and are user-specific:

- **GET `/api/api-keys`** - Returns only the current user's API keys
- **POST `/api/api-keys`** - Creates API keys for the current user only
- **PUT `/api/api-keys`** - Updates only the current user's API keys
- **DELETE `/api/api-keys`** - Deletes only the current user's API keys
- **POST `/api/api-keys/regenerate`** - Regenerates only the current user's API keys

### Authentication
- All API key operations now require user authentication via NextAuth.js session
- Proper error handling for unauthenticated and unauthorized requests
- User ownership validation for all operations

### Frontend Updates
- **Enhanced error messages** for authentication and authorization issues
- **User-specific data fetching** in the dashboard
- **Updated TypeScript interfaces** to include `user_id` field

## Migration Guide

### For Development Environment

1. **Run the migration script:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute the migration in your Supabase SQL editor
   \i supabase/migrations/001_add_user_id_to_api_keys.sql
   ```

2. **Clear existing API keys** (recommended for development):
   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE api_keys;
   ```

3. **Make user_id required:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE api_keys ALTER COLUMN user_id SET NOT NULL;
   ```

### For Production Environment

1. **Run the migration script** (without truncating data)
2. **Assign existing API keys to users:**
   ```sql
   -- Option 1: Assign all to first user
   UPDATE api_keys SET user_id = (SELECT id FROM users LIMIT 1) WHERE user_id IS NULL;
   
   -- Option 2: Delete orphaned keys
   DELETE FROM api_keys WHERE user_id IS NULL;
   ```

3. **Make user_id required:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE api_keys ALTER COLUMN user_id SET NOT NULL;
   ```

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. User Authentication
- Sign in with different Google accounts
- Verify each user sees only their own API keys

### 2. API Key Operations
- Create API keys as different users
- Verify users cannot see/edit each other's keys
- Test bulk operations (delete, status updates)

### 3. API Usage
- Use API keys in the GitHub summarizer endpoint
- Verify usage tracking is user-specific
- Test API key validation with user context

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own API keys
- **Service Role Access**: Admin operations still work via service role
- **Automatic Enforcement**: Database-level security prevents data leaks

### API Validation
- **Session-based Authentication**: Uses NextAuth.js sessions
- **Ownership Verification**: Double-checks user ownership on sensitive operations
- **Proper Error Handling**: Clear messages for auth/authorization failures

### Usage Tracking
- **User-specific Analytics**: Track API usage per user
- **Individual Limits**: Each user has their own usage limits
- **Isolated Metrics**: User data remains separate

## API Response Changes

### Before (Global API Keys)
```json
{
  "id": "key-123",
  "name": "My API Key",
  "api_key": "smo-xxx"
}
```

### After (User-Specific API Keys)
```json
{
  "id": "key-123",
  "user_id": "user-456", 
  "name": "My API Key",
  "api_key": "smo-xxx"
}
```

### GitHub Summarizer Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "summary": {...},
  "apiKeyInfo": {
    "name": "My API Key",
    "permissions": "read",
    "user": {
      "id": "user-456",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Multi-User Support**: Multiple users can use the platform independently
2. **Data Privacy**: Each user's API keys are completely isolated
3. **Individual Quotas**: Per-user usage limits and tracking
4. **Better Analytics**: User-specific metrics and insights
5. **Scalability**: Supports growing user base efficiently

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Please log in to access your API keys"**
- User session has expired
- Solution: Sign in again

**"You can only update your own API keys"**
- Trying to modify another user's API key
- Solution: This is working as intended for security

**"Failed to create API key" with 401 error**
- Authentication required
- Solution: Ensure user is signed in

### Development Tips

- Use the test key generator for quick testing
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify user session status in NextAuth.js
- Use Supabase dashboard to inspect database state

## Future Enhancements

- **Team/Organization Support**: Share API keys within teams
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Different user roles (admin, user, readonly)
- **API Key Scopes**: Fine-grained permissions per key
- **Usage Analytics Dashboard**: Per-user usage visualizations
